# Resist D. Trump

There is an avalanche coming out of the Trump administration, so much that it is overwhelming to keep up resistance to the most egregious actions.  This site 

* is run from a single collaborative spreadsheet
* focuses on the top actions
* only includes factual events with citable sources
* is collaboratively curated (If you know how to use a spreadsheet, we need you to volunteer to help with this!)

The web page keeps visitors from being overloaded by serving up one action at a time, and cross-references the action → tags → specific acts of resistance that you, the citizen, can do right now.  If the current action isn't enough to convince you to resist, click for the next one!

# Help Needed

- [ ] Collaboration:  We desperately need people to help fill out the source spreadsheet!
- [ ] Tagging: if a visitor is interested in a specific type of action, and they click on it, their next action should be filtered to that type.
- [ ] Optimization: Which actions drive the most resistance?  We think we can figure that out using Google Analytics if we treat the "take action" buttons like a funnel.
